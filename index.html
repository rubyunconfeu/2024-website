      <h2>What is Ruby Unconf?</h2>
      <p>
        Ruby Unconf is a community-driven event. It is a conference with a
        twist: There is no schedule until the participants create it. The
        attendees propose talks and workshops, which are then scheduled by
        popular vote. The goal is to create a conference that is shaped by the
        needs and interests of the participants. You decide what will happen!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ruby Unconf is a non-profit event. We want to keep the ticket price as
        low as possible to make the event accessible to everyone. We are
        looking for sponsors to help us cover the costs of the event. If you
        are interested in sponsoring Ruby Unconf, please get in touch with us.

      <h2>Propose a talk</h2>
      <p>
        We recommend to prepare slides for your talk. The talk length will be
        half an hour. You get the chance to pitch your talk at the beginning
        of each conference day. Besides talks different formats like workshops
        or panel discussions are welcome.<br />
        Also we're open for other formats like fishbowl discussions or activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can propose a talk or workshop on any topic you like.
        You can propose a talk before the event or on the day of the event.<br />
        If you want to propose a talk before the event, you can
        <a href="https://github.com/rubyunconfeu/2024-talk-proposals/issues/new?assignees=&labels=talk+request&projects=&template=talk-request.md&title=">create an issue</a>
        on our <a href="https://github.com/rubyunconfeu/2024-talk-proposals">talk proposal
        repository on GitHub</a>. We'll pre-print them before the event, so you don't
        have to write them down on the day of the event.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to propose a talk on the day of the event, we'll provide
        paper templates for you to write down your talk proposal.
        The talks will be scheduled by popular vote on each day of the event.
      </p>
      <p>
        For shorter talks, we'll have a lightning talk session.

        The 2024 Ruby Unconf is back at 
        <a href="https://www.haw-hamburg.de/" target="_blank">HAW Hamburg Finkenau</a> again.
        (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?from=&amp;to=53.56922%2C10.03495#map=19/53.56909/10.03470" target="_blank">Finkenau 35, 22081 Hamburg, Germany</a>)

        <h4>Hamburg</h4>

        Quoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg">Wikipedia</a>:

        <blockquote>
          Hamburg, officially the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, is the second-largest city in Germany after Berlin
          and 8th largest city in the European Union with a population of over 1.8 million. 
        </blockquote>

        Getting to Hamburg is easy. By bike, train, car, plane - even by boat.
        The <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hamburg">Wikivoyage travel guide</a> sums up everything you need to
        know about getting to and getting around Hamburg, finding a place to stay or even moving here.

        Latest news were published on our X/Twitter feed. You can easily leave us a note on X, but via GitHub Issue
        or e-mail is also fine. On the conference itself we ask our participants if it's ok to have pictures taken with
        them. We won't publish pictures of people opting out of that. In case we accidentally did please leave us a note
        so we can remove the image.
